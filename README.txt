OMFGDOGS!

All aspects of requested work have been correctly implemented:
	-audio file
	-tiled background gif
	-link at bottom of page
	
Ross Schlaikjer installed linux on my computer and showed me how to install
git, so you should basically give him a thousand bonus points. 

This assignment took about three hours, because a lot of it was 
futzing around in github and figuring out how things connected to 
each other. It was silly and wasted time. Time spent actually DOING the
project was maybe an hour.
